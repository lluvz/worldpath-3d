1.  clean up the w,h & s.
    if three.js has its own way, this has to be removed.
2.  Problem: fps checkbox auto.
3.  Make settings a adding function?

Mission:
1.3d background.
2.raycast bug need to be fixed.
3.shadow problem.
4.dark cave problem can be partly solved by lowering ambient light.
5.mobile operation need to be added.
6.check out whether service worker can be a server to other players.

Conclusions:
2.  Soft rasterization:
3.  Raycast is calculated in CPU!(On the vertix array).
4.  CPU cannot go through all the blocks in a few seconds, GPU cannot either.
    This calculation being done asychronosly is a need, and when the blocks changed,
    only the vertices of the changed blocks should be changed.
