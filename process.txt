1.  clean up the w,h & s.
    if three.js has its own way, this has to be removed.
2.  Problem: fps checkbox auto.
3.  Make settings a adding function?

Mission:
1.3d background.
2.raycast which need to written in every face.
3.shadow problem.
4.dark cave problem can be partly solved by lowering ambient light.

Conclusions:
2.  Soft rasterization:
3.  Raycast is calculated in CPU!(On the vertix array).
4.  CPU cannot go through all the blocks in a few seconds, GPU cannot either.
    This calculation being done asychronosly is a need, and when the blocks changed,
    only the vertices of the changed blocks should be changed.
